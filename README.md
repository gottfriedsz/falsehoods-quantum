# Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Quantum Technology

Common misconceptions about quantum technology and computers.

1. Quantum computers will destroy the internet.
2. All cryptography algorithms are since Shor broken.
3. You need to have an PhD in Physics to work with quantum computers.
5. Quantum computers are to only application of quantum technology.
6. Quantum computers should be cooled in space, because it is already cold out there.
7. Quantum computers are not solving for real applications.
8. Quantum computers will replace all classical computers.
9. Quantum computers can used to solve all existing problems.
10. There will always be errors that prevent quantum computers to be useful.
11. Quantum computers kills blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
12. We have already reached Quantum Supremacy.
13. Access to quantum computers is limited to rich people.
14. Similar: access to quantum computers is limited to scientists.
15. Quantum computers best use for large data.
16. Qubits are in state 0 and 1 at the same time.
17. With entangled qubits you can send information faster than speed of light.
18. The cat in Schr√∂dinger's thought experiment has really died.
19. Quantum computer promises infinite speedup for any computation.
20. A qubit can be stored in a hard disk or USB stick like a normal bit.
21. Eight qubits grouped together are a qubyte. 
22. An enterprise architect will tell me, when I have to use it. 
23. Business will tell me, when I have to use it.
24. I have to learn strange languages to use quantum computers.
25. My SHA256, MD5,... is safe enough for the next decade (see harvest now, decrypt later)
26. I don't need quantum computers, I am in the cloud and already using kubernetes.
27. More qubits is all you need. There is nothing else then quantum circuits.
